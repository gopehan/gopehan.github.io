    <h1>  The Calvin cycle is a process that plants and algae use to turn carbon dioxide from the air into sugar, the food autotrophs need to grow.

Every living thing on Earth depends on the Calvin cycle. Plants depend on the Calvin cycle for energy and food. Other organisms, including herbivores, also depend on it indirectly because they depend on plants for food. Even organisms that eat other organisms, such as carnivores, depend on the Calvin cycle. Without it, they wouldn't have the food, energy, and nutrients they need to survive.

The Calvin cycle has four main steps: carbon fixation, reduction phase, carbohydrate formation, and regeneration phase. Energy to fuel chemical reactions in this sugar-generating process is provided by ATP and NADPH, chemical compounds which contain the energy plants have captured from sunlight.</h1>
